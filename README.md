# Linux programming basics
In this repository you can find a set of questions to answer which will help anyone to set-up a basic development environment in their computer and a pool of tasks to practice each subject. The questions cover:

1. Linux as an operating system: A little bit of history and some basic abstract concepts
2. Linux filesystem: Directory structure, browsing in the terminal, permisology and users
3. Code version control: Abstract concepts of versioning and git basics
4. Package managers: Abstract concepts and examples

# About the project
These questions and tasks are part of [this project](https://jcao02.github.io/linux-programming-basics/), but by themselves, they are not the complete picture of it. They're two of the three parts needed to train someone in programming basics: The third part involves a tutor for a discussion on the questionaries, hence the questions are a guide for practice and not an academic base.

## Tutors
Feel free to contact any of the tutors explaining the reasons you want to learn how to program.
