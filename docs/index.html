        This is not a regular programming class. We will not teach you how to make a website or how to manage a database. We will change your mindset so you can learn it by yourself.

            <h5 class="mt-0">Code is not magic. Someone had to write it</h5>
            So don't be afraid of it! Everything you see in your computer was coded by a human being, so you can understand whatever they did.
            If you don't understand a behavior, you can always read the source code and if you don't like it, you can always change it! (as long is legal)

            <h5 class="mt-0">Coding is a mindset</h5>
            It doesn't require years of learning programming languages and math. We think people only need to learn to set-up a development environment and
            to change their mindset toward the computer: It is not a rigid and inmutable object, you can play with it, change its configuration and customize it.

            <h5 class="mt-0">Coding requires useful practice</h5>
            Our teaching is practical, but we don't make you code an Android chat sample just for the sake of it. The practices are useful, real products or applications.
            We want you to understand the power you just acquired by building things that are actually used by someone (even yourself).

        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
          As a Venezuelan, I've witnessed how many of my people are facing economic difficulties inside and outside our country because all the crisis we're living today.
          I'm also aware that we're not the only country facing adversity, but there's people from all over the world trying to survive with little help.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, as a Software Engineer, I'm aware of the deficit and the over-demand of programmers there's today in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I created this project becasue I believe that if we want to improve our societies, we must start as individuals and we (Software Engineers) can teach other people to code and provide them with tools to grow and overcome the obstacles they're facing.
