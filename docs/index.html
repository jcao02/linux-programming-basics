        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
          As a Venezuelan, I've witnessed how many of my people are facing economic difficulties inside and outside our country because all the crisis we're living today.
          I'm also aware that we're not the only country facing adversity, but there's people from all over the world trying to survive with little help.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, as a Software Engineer, I'm aware of the deficit and the over-demand of programmers there's today in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I created this project becasue I believe that if we want to improve our societies, we must start as individuals and we (Software Engineers) can teach <strong>for free</strong> other people facing adversity to code almost anything by teaching coding princpiples and providing them
          with tools to grow and overcome the obstacles they're facing.
